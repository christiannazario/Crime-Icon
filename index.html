                Manhattans southern precinct has seen an increase of over 3,000 cases of Grand larceny this year compared to last year.
			</p>
			<p> New York City overall saw an increase in the first few weeks of 2022 of grand auto larceny, 1,187. To put that in perspective, 2021 had 620 in the first weeks of the year. 

                <p>Mayor Adams announced a few months ago a task force to go after gun crime. Gun crime in the city, 
                 while still a problem to New Yorkers statistically, has increased but just a few numbers citywide. 
                </p>
			
			</p>
            <p> It remains to be seen if any of this will help as crime reports from the New York City Police Department track an increase of 41% in overall crime through the first few months of 2022. 
                Official statistics, according to Reuters show an increase in certain categories but are still far lower than the numbers from three decades ago. Some of the crimes that have seen a spike are major offenses, 
                here are the top crimes pre and post pandemic
